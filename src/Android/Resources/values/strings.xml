  <string name="AutoFillServiceDescription">
    It can be difficult for users (especially those with disabilities) to switch between apps and copy/paste
    username and password information from their bitwarden vault.\n\nThe use of this accessibility service allows bitwarden
    to detect and read input fields on your device\'s screen. Whenever bitwarden detects a password field on the screen
    a notification will appear that allows you to easily access your bitwarden vault and automatically fill (auto-fill)
    the correct login information into the necessary fields.
