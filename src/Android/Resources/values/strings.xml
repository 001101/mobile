    bitwarden uses this accessibility service to aid in filling username and password fields in other apps and on the web.

  <string name="AutoFillServiceDescription">
    It can be difficult for users (especially those with disabilities) to switch back and forth between apps to copy and paste
    username and password data from your bitwarden vault. The use of this accessibility service allows
    bitwarden to read and detect input fields on your device\'s screen. Whenever bitwarden detects a passwords field on the
    screen a notification will appear that allows you to easily access your bitwarden vault and select the correct
    login information for those fields.
    Once you select the login information from your vault, bitwarden will auto-fill the data into the app or website login
    fields.
